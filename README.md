# Superheater

Superheater is designed for efficient magic and smithing training, offering a specialized alternative to traditional methods. It focuses on enhancing xp rates in superheating, with the ability to handle all bars for both magic and smithing experience, reaching up to 180k xp/h in total.

## Script Tips
- For cost efficiency, consider Iron Bars which can provide 3m smithing xp (level 15-84) with 99 magic, potentially without profit/loss.
- For experience-focused training, Gold Bars with Gold Gauntlets are recommended for reaching 99 smithing with 99 magic, albeit with an estimated loss of over 40m.

## Script Goals
- Implement different efficiency modes
- Develop profit/loss calculations
- Add checks for Staff & Gold gauntlets (if gold bar is selected)

## Credits
A nod to @sebastiaan and their lunar plank_make script, which laid the groundwork for this Superheater script.
