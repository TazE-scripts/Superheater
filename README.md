# Superheater
Perfect for training magic and smithing!

## Features
- Superheats all bars for magic and smithing xp
- Up to 180k xp/h total
- Optional GUI
- Perfect for accounts without lunar spell-book
- Any bank location supported

## Requirements
- Equipped any Fire Staff for unlimited Fire Runes
- 32-Bit Native OSRS Client
- 43 magic for casting superheat
- Smithing level for selected bar type
- Start script close to selected bank, default grand exchange
- For best experience have the ores and nature rune visable without scroll

## Known Issues
- Rarely when starting script, it will deposit all items and attempt to cast spell, just restart.

## Limitations
- Does not check if you have required Smithing/Magic level
- Does not check if you have equipped staff or gold gauntlets (gold bar)

## Future implementation Wishlist
- Set different efficiency modes
- Profit/Loss calculations
- Check for Staff & Gold gauntlets (if gold bar)

## Recommended bars
- Check out the most cost efficient bars at https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Superheat_Item#Cost_effectiveness
- Personal recommendation is  Iron Bar which will net 3m smithing xp (Level 15-84)  with 99 magic without profit/loss
- Alternative Bar is Gold Bar with Gold Gauntlets which will net you 99 smithing with 99 magic but with a loss of 40m+

Special thanks to @sebastiaan for the lunar plank_make script which was the initial stepping stones for this script.
